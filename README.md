# xc-megademo
A demonstration of using XC=BASIC 3 to program the MEGA65 in full color graphics mode.

Read more about XC=BASIC in the [manual](https://xc-basic.net/doku.php?id=v3:start).

# Getting Started

Download and install [xc-basic 3](https://github.com/neilsf/xc-basic3)
and the [DASM assembler](https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm).

Make sure that you have a MEGA65 emulator installed, for example xemu-xmega65.

Put the correct paths to these programs in the Makefile.

Type "make" to run the example program.
